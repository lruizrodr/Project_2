# Lizard Powered Engine 🦎

## Overview  
**Lizard Powered Engine** is a custom-built search engine that uses the Giphy API to fetch and display lizard-themed
 GIFs (and beyond). The project was created as part of a **Software Engineering Bootcamp** to practice building a fully
  functional frontend web app with **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript**, while also learning how to integrate external APIs.  

Users can:  
- Enter a search term  
- Fetch GIFs dynamically from the Giphy API  
- View results in a responsive card-based layout  
- Navigate between **Home, About, and Contact pages**  

The website is styled with **SCSS** for maintainability and responsiveness, with mobile-first considerations.
